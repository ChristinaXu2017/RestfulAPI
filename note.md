## why spring boot
refer to [spring boot feature](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- It's built on top of the Spring Framework and simplifies its setup and usage.
- It provides a simpler approach to start Spring projects by auto-configuring the setup based on the included dependencies. 
- It comes with embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow, so you don't need to deploy your applications onto separate servers.
- It provides production-ready features like health checks, metrics, etc., through Spring Boot Actuator.
